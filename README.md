# Welcome to the repository!
This repository is made to store the Jupyer notebooks I have created while learning Data Science. Some of them were made with inspiration from some another great and informative notebooks. All the necessary copyrights and references have been mentioned in the notebooks itself. 

## List of projects:
1. [Admission Chance Prediction](https://github.com/vishxm/DataScienceNBs/tree/master/ChanceOfAdmit) using student's GRE, TOEFL, CGPA, etc scores. 
2. [Heart Failure Prediction](https://github.com/vishxm/DataScienceNBs/tree/master/HeartFailure) using patient's age, sex, serum levels, etc. Patient's anemia and smoking status were also taken into consideration to predict.
3. [PDF Scraping to find top colleges :](https://github.com/vishxm/DataScienceNBs/tree/master/CapGuideTask) Top 10 colleges to pursue Civil Engineering were listed whose home university was Savitribai Phule.
4. [Customer Intention Prediction](https://github.com/vishxm/DataScienceNBs/tree/master/CustomerIntention) done using the number duration spent on administrative, informational and related-products page.
